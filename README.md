# Twitter-Bot

#### Our project is a twitter bot that uses a machine learning classifier to detect cyberbullying and automatically reply to the tweet to warn the user not to bully. We chose Twitter for this project because it was simple to search through tweets and reply with a bot, but in the future, we could expand this project for other social media platforms.
